# WDI_PROJECT1_THE_GAME
Creating a Hangman type game

Hang Person is a simple word guess gaming that can be played with friends. (This game is still in beta).

The idea of the game is simple, guess the word before you end up feeling the **noose!**.

Open source code bases were used to assist with this project.
